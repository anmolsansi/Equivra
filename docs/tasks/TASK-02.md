# TASK-02 — Normalize exact source profiles and freeze scenario fixtures

Status: future implementation packet. Coding authorization and G0/provider gates are not passed. TASK-01 owns bootstrap/G0 and may start only after coding authorization; downstream packets wait the declared handoffs. No done claim.

**Objective**
Normalize exact source profiles and freeze scenario fixtures.

**Why this task exists**
Own the approved Sources outcome without weakening money/evidence/version/access/recovery guarantees. No extra product scope.

**Workstream / execution wave**
Sources, W1 (start wave, not merge permission).

**Depends on**
- TASK-01 via C-FOUNDATION; start=G0 + design-frozen shapes and fixtures; merge=Provider executable conformance for C-FOUNDATION

**Blocks / consumers**
- TASK-03 via C-SOURCE
- TASK-05 via C-SOURCE
- TASK-06 via C-SOURCE
- TASK-07 via C-SOURCE
- TASK-09 via C-SOURCE
- TASK-10 via C-SOURCE
- TASK-11 via C-SOURCE
- TASK-12 via C-SOURCE
- INT-01 via INT-01

**Inputs**
Approved PRD/design; repo_context verified baseline; architecture and S1-S8 scenario definitions; complete consumed/produced contract records copied below. No provider-private implementation knowledge.

**Outputs**
Owned files, required behavior/conformance tests, and recorded verification outcomes; only produced contracts may be declared executable-frozen after passing checks.

**Files to inspect first**
- docs/repo_context.md — baseline/actual command evidence.
- docs/architecture.md — authoritative schema/API/source/financial/transaction design.
- docs/demo-scenarios.md; docs/contracts/examples/manifest.json, stripe.csv, bank.csv, books.csv, books-corrected.csv, expected.json, api-responses.json and snapshot.json — existing explicitly synthetic examples.
- This packet. Premium rule root: /Users/mac/.codex/plugins/cache/personal/premium-product-builder/0.1.0/skills/premium-product-builder/. Named rules relative to that root: security_rules.md, testing_rules.md, product_quality_bar.md; backend_rules.md/api_rules.md/database_rules.md for those boundaries, frontend_rules.md for UI. Skill rules cannot expand approved scope.

**Owned files**
- CREATE shared/source.ts
- CREATE shared/money.ts
- CREATE tests/unit/source.test.ts
- CREATE tests/unit/money.test.ts
- CREATE tests/fixtures/scenarios.json

**Non-owned / do-not-touch files**
All files outside the owned list.
- package.json — another packet or architect owns it; no casual contract edits.
- package-lock.json — another packet or architect owns it; no casual contract edits.
- db/001_initial.sql — another packet or architect owns it; no casual contract edits.
- server/app.ts — another packet or architect owns it; no casual contract edits.
- server/worker.ts — another packet or architect owns it; no casual contract edits.
- web/src/App.tsx — another packet or architect owns it; no casual contract edits.
- docs/contracts/registry.json — another packet or architect owns it; no casual contract edits.
- .git/, .gstack/, .codex/, .agents/ and external attachments — no edits. Shared files may change only in the explicitly serialized owner stage.

**Scope**
Only the objective, owned files and steps below; retain all approved source/money/access/version/uncertainty constraints.

**Out of scope**
Real data, hosting, SaaS accounts, AI/live connectors, payment/accounting writes, universal formats and unrelated features.

**User-facing behavior**
For source/domain/storage-only work: internal prerequisite surfaced by later declared UI/API. For access/import/review/report/web: exactly the methods/states in copied C-API and the acceptance criteria, no extra flow.

**Data model**
Full C-DB record pasted below when consumed/produced; otherwise N/A — no DB schema ownership. Only TASK-03 may change the initial schema.

**API contract**
Full C-API and provider-specific record pasted below when consumed/produced; otherwise N/A — no HTTP surface in this pure/foundation task.

**UI states**
N/A for pure/internal-only task. Browser-facing behavior must distinguish loading, empty, validation/dependency error, success, incomplete/ambiguous/difference, stale conflict and unavailable access; never hide uncertainty. Exact field/error mappings are the copied wire contract.

**Validation rules**
Use complete copied source/API limits and enums. Common safe message mapping: INVALID_ACCESS=Enter the current local startup code.; STALE_VERSION=Evidence or review changed; reload before submitting.; INVALID_SOURCE=Invalid source; review the named field details.; LIMIT_EXCEEDED=Source exceeds the supported input limit.; DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE=Local dependency unavailable; retry when restored.; INTERNAL_ERROR=Operation failed; use the correlation reference. Do not echo raw value/path/secret. Other code-specific messages name the failed operation and action without guessing facts.

**Auth & permissions**
C-ACCESS current-start local reviewer gate before application routes; worker restricted role only. Protected data may not be read from health/static shell or unguarded route.

**Integration contract**
Complete provider/consumer records below are the only handoff. No private source knowledge; compatibility/versioning and fixture change protocol binding.

**Manual QA**
After G0 and provider readiness, use the documented synthetic bundle. For internal tasks run their declared behavior test and inspect expected facts/errors. For browser/API tasks exercise success plus one invalid/unauthorized/stale/failure branch and verify visible recovery. At convergence walk S1 then S4/S6/S7; compare6680 subtotal and missing refund evidence, never claim current application behavior before implementation.

**Do not change**
No files outside ownership, no approved behavior/limits or frozen contract without architect change record. No history deletion or external publication.

**Contracts consumed**
C-FOUNDATION

**Contracts produced**
C-SOURCE

**Implementation steps**
1. Implement exact manifest/header/encoding/date/identity/byte/row/field rules in C-SOURCE. No heuristic column mapping.
2. Parse decimal amounts to signed integer-cent strings using BigInt arithmetic, preserving raw values and file/record lineage.
3. Freeze valid/invalid S1-S8 fixtures including corrected whole bundle, header-only scope, duplicate IDs, unknown category, dispute identity limits and boundary sizes.

**Invariants affected**
- INV-02: All monetary arithmetic uses exact integer cents, currency usd, source values preserved; gross-fee=net verified; no guessed fees.
- INV-03: An accepted input pins a complete three-file immutable revision and durable run/job; no acknowledged partial or dangling bundle.
- INV-04: Source event identities remain distinct; duplicate submission/recovery creates one owning financial result; corrections and stale jobs cannot overwrite other revisions.
- INV-08: Enforce10000 data rows/10MiB per source and bounded parsing/errors; source text inert; secrets/raw rows absent from logs.

**Failure/error semantics**
Apply exact named errors in copied contracts: invalid input422/400/413, access401/403/429, missing404, stale/replay/integrity409, dependencies503, unexpected500 safe correlation. Known uncertainty is an evidence state, not an empty success. Roll back rejected writes; never silently coerce money, truncate sources, overwrite history or complete failed jobs.

**Security/privacy**
Synthetic-only. Parameterized SQL, generated storage identifiers, owning-revision links, source text escaped, startup code/raw financial text redacted. Current access/Origin/Host before browser mutation. Worker cannot invent reviewer decisions or move money.

**Observability**
Runtime owner emits operation/correlation/bundle/run/job/snapshot IDs, outcome/error/attempt/duration with no raw text/secrets. Pure source/domain functions return typed diagnostics; caller logs once. No new monitoring vendor.

**Migration/backfill/compatibility**
TASK-03 owns initial schema. Others consume its constraints unchanged. No real-data backfill. V1 source/rule/API/snapshot changes follow architect change protocol and update all fixtures/consumers. Preserve immutable history; coordinated compatible rollback only.

**Required tests**
- 100.00->10000, -30.00->-3000, supplied9680 net and6680 payout subtotal; reject exponent/excess precision/bound/currency.
- Table-driven BOM/multiline/quoting/duplicate header/UTF8/NUL/empty/date/ID/limit cases, with exact-bound and one-over assertions.
- Equal amounts with distinct external IDs survive; header-only is zero observed activity, not real completeness.
- Regression: retain every relevant S1-S8 accepted money/uncertainty/replay/correction/review/report/access bound; no old tests exist to retire.

**Verification commands**
Current repository application commands: NONE verified. Host versions were inspected but do not prove Node24. After TASK-01 G0, exact proposed scripts are npm run typecheck, npm run build, npm run test:unit, npm run test:integration, npm run test:e2e, npm run db:migrate as applicable under pinned Node24 local environment. They are specifications until created/inspected/invoked and recorded in repo_context. Missing/failed/zero-test suite is not acceptance. Run the behavior-specific families listed above; do not broaden unrelated suites without cause.

**Acceptance criteria**
1. PASS/FAIL: Documented example normalizes with exact amounts and stable raw row refs.
2. PASS/FAIL: Every invalid source yields bounded named diagnostic and no runnable partial bundle.
3. PASS/FAIL: Corrected books contains supplied -3000 and no invented fee/treatment.
4. PASS/FAIL: Consumer fixture/schema conformance is frozen without private parser knowledge.

**Rollback / recovery**
Version profile and update all consumers/fixtures for changes; never reinterpret accepted old source bytes silently.

**Downstream handoff**
Give consumer the frozen shape/examples/error/version/ownership semantics copied below plus actual provider conformance. It must not need provider-private code. Mark every unverified contract not-yet-consumable and block merge. Runtime-only packets hand off checkpoint evidence without changing the protocol.

**Definition of done**
All owned code/tests/docs/config complete; all numbered criteria and applicable verified commands pass; produced contracts executable-frozen or explicitly blocked; no hidden design choice assigned to builder; unrelated files untouched. This packet is not currently implemented.

**Effort**
1.5 engineer days at8h/day, preliminary sizing <=3-day cap; main cost is behavior/integration verification. TASK-01 is an atomic bootstrap exception to the usual small file count: splitting required runtime/type/mock configuration into file-only tickets would not yield independent outcomes. Calendar pace is10h/week; no measured AI speedup or completion promise.

**Source Of Truth**
docs/architecture.md sections 1-3 and CREATE package.json, package-lock.json, tsconfig.server.json, web/package.json, Dockerfile, compose.yaml

**Inputs**
Node24 container baseline; local PostgreSQL18; DATABASE_URL local/test-only; EQUIVRA_DATA_DIR server-owned; loopback API127.0.0.1:4310. Separate API/worker/migration DB URLs; allow loopback or fixed Compose hostname db, not arbitrary remote hosts. Disposable tests require name equivra_test_<random hex>; never reset the primary DB.

**Outputs**
Pinned package/lockfile; ESM TypeScript build; script names typecheck, build, test:unit, test:integration, test:e2e, verify, db:migrate, start:api, start:worker. Host Node25 is not baseline proof.
Exact proposed package scripts (not current verified commands):
{
  "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.server.json && tsc --noEmit -p web/tsconfig.json",
  "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.server.json && npm --workspace web run build",
  "test:unit": "node --test dist/tests/unit/*.test.js",
  "test:integration": "node --test --test-concurrency=1 dist/tests/integration/*.test.js",

  "db:migrate": "node dist/db/migrate.js",
  "start:api": "node dist/server/main.js",
  "start:worker": "node dist/server/worker.js"
}
Test scripts must fail on absent suites; G0 records command definitions and the executable readiness of each family separately. Integration requires a disposable local test DB; browser tests use Playwright library under the Node runner. No automatic zero-test PASS. init:local = node scripts/init-local.mjs; generated .env must be0600, no overwrite/secret print; setup utility may run on host Node>=22 while actual app checks use Node24 container. Shared pure canonicalJson(value: JSONValue):string sorts object keys recursively, preserves array order, emits compact UTF8 JSON with ordinary JSON string escaping; disallow non-JSON/unsafe numeric values. CREATE shared/canonical.ts, used for bundle, request and snapshot hashes. Runtime symbols: server/config.ts loadConfig(env):AppConfig; server/db.ts openDb(url):Pool and withTransaction(pool, fn(client)):Promise<T>; server/app.ts createApp(config,deps:{db:Pool,boss:PgBoss}):Promise<FastifyInstance>. All app money remains strings.

**Preconditions**
No application currently exists. TASK-01 may create only its owned foundation files after implementation authorization.

**Postconditions**
Record exact commands and observed outcomes in docs/repo_context.md. Reject public host publication and wrong DB/test targets; ignore generated data/build/secret directories.

**Error Semantics**
Bad config or incompatible schema/runtime fails startup; never fall back to a remote database/public bind. Missing test families cannot be reported passing.

**Idempotency Retry**
Clean setup repeatable; no automatic destructive reset. migrations serialized.

**Ordering Concurrency**
Own shared root configuration once; later tasks may not casually edit scripts/lockfile.

**Fixture**
docs/contracts/examples/* existing data; CREATE tests/support/mock-api.ts during TASK-01 for the fixed API shapes in C-API.

**Freeze Point**
G0: package script definitions, pinned runtime/dependencies and command invocation results recorded; downstream command readiness remains blocked until this evidence exists.

**Verification**
Current verified host commands: node --version=v25.8.1, npm --version=11.11.0, docker --version=29.0.1, git --version=2.50.1. Planned commands are not repo-verified today. G0 must inspect package scripts and run defined checks in the selected Node24 environment.

**Lifecycle**
v1 is design-frozen after this plan review; executable freeze requires provider conformance and foundation evidence. No implicit backward-incompatible changes.

**Change Protocol**
Identify every consumer; update this record, examples, generated/typed interfaces, affected packets and edges; rerun conformance; re-sequence before merging a breaking change.

**Security**
Local synthetic demo only; protect application routes with current startup code, exact Host/Origin and owning-revision validation. Never expose secrets or local paths.
Binding contract: browser origin/Host127.0.0.1:4310; host-native listener127.0.0.1 only. Fixed Compose image listener0.0.0.0:4310 is internal only and MUST use host publication127.0.0.1:4310:4310; never public host publication. Reject arbitrary bind configuration. Docker peer IP is not authentication; Host/Origin/Bearer remain mandatory. Test published host interfaces and deny hostile Host/Origin.

**Source Of Truth**
docs/architecture.md sections 8-9; examples/manifest.json,stripe.csv,bank.csv,books.csv,books-corrected.csv,expected.json; CREATE shared/source.ts, shared/money.ts

**Inputs**
Manifest schema_version equivra.bundle.v1, workspace_id demo, source_account_id acct_demo, currency usd, period and per-source half-open date coverage. Exact header arrays in architecture section9. UTF8 CSV, at most10000 data records and10485760 bytes/file; field4096 codepoints, description2048, record32768 bytes. Dates real UTC/RFC3339Z or YYYY-MM-DD as specified. External IDs ASCII [A-Za-z0-9_:-]{1,128}.
### Manifest v1

`{schema_version:'equivra.bundle.v1',workspace_id:'demo',source_account_id:'acct_demo',currency:'usd',period:{start:YYYY-MM-DD,end_exclusive:YYYY-MM-DD},coverage:{stripe:{start,end_exclusive},bank:{start,end_exclusive},books:{start,end_exclusive}}}`. Dates are real calendar dates, UTC interpretation, start<end, max370 days per range. Period must be contained in each declared coverage; adjacent-period evidence is permitted. These are supplied-scope declarations, not independent proofs that all activity was exported. Actual row event/posting dates must lie within their declared source coverage.

### Source schemas

| Source | Exact CSV headers and constraints |
|---|---|
| stripe | `balance_transaction_id,created_utc,available_on_utc,currency,gross,fee,net,reporting_category,automatic_payout_id,automatic_payout_effective_at_utc,source_id,charge_id` |
| bank | `bank_row_id,posted_on,currency,amount,payout_ref,description` |
| books | `entry_id,posted_on,currency,amount,processor_ref,description` |

Stripe `created_utc`, `available_on_utc`, `automatic_payout_effective_at_utc` are RFC3339 UTC strings ending Z. created/available required; payout-effective may be empty only when payout_id empty. bank/books posted_on is YYYY-MM-DD. currency must be usd. IDs balance_transaction_id/bank_row_id/entry_id are required and unique within their source; a duplicated ID is invalid even with equal values. Required nonidentity references may be empty and create an incomplete/unsupported relationship; never synthesize references from amounts.

Money accepts a signed decimal with up to10 integer digits and optional1–2 fractional digits, no exponent/thousands/currency symbols/whitespace; normalize to BigInt cents and preserve original text. Bound absolute row amount at9999999999.99 USD. `gross - fee == net` must hold exactly; failure is INVALID_MONEY_BRIDGE rather than an AI-correctable difference. Negative fees are accepted only as supplied exact source values, not invented refunds. Aggregate bounds fit signed64-bit cents for the approved row envelope; check before serialization/storage.

Stripe supported categories: `charge`, `refund`, `dispute`, `dispute_reversal`; all other valid categories remain `unsupported` evidence cases and prevent a claim that the affected payout lifecycle is fully supported. `source_id` identifies related processor object; charge_id groups original-payment lineage, not event identity. Dispute reversal needs an explicit supplied source/charge link; if its exact dispute reference cannot be established, show both movements and limited lineage without asserting same-dispute resolution. No heuristic charge-level identity substitutes for an absent dispute identity.

Books is **net activity in a synthetic processor clearing account**, not a general ledger export. Positive amount increases that clearing balance; negative decreases it. processor_ref must reference a Stripe balance_transaction_id for a supported direct relationship. Multiple book lines with the same processor_ref may sum to that event's net; preserve all entry_ids and compare exact signed totals. This profile excludes bank-transfer/payout-clearing journal lines so it does not double-count settlement. Unlinked or out-of-profile references remain unresolved; no accounting treatment is prescribed.



**Outputs**
ParsedSource={kind:stripe|bank|books,sha256,bytes,row_count,rows:[{row_no,raw_fields,normalized}]}; raw_fields maps exact headers to original strings. Stripe normalized fields preserve IDs/dates/category and gross_minor,fee_minor,net_minor integer strings; bank normalized amount_minor and payout_ref; books normalized amount_minor and processor_ref. parseMoney(decimal:string):string returns signed cents (no exponent; <=10 integer digits,<=2 decimals). Exports validateManifest(value:unknown):Manifest, parseMoney(decimal:string):string and parseSource(kind, bytes:AsyncIterable<Uint8Array>, coverage):Promise<ParsedSource>; callers may not depend on parser private helpers.

**Preconditions**
All three kinds supplied; manifest range start<end_exclusive and <=370 days; period lies in each coverage; each row date inside its declared coverage. No filename/path used as storage authority.

**Postconditions**
Exact gross-fee=net; no unsafe rounding. Header-only source accepted as zero observations with explicit coverage warning; zero-byte/malformed source rejected. Distinct external IDs survive identical amounts; duplicate source identity rejected. No claim of actual complete financial records.

**Error Semantics**
422 INVALID_MANIFEST, INVALID_SOURCE, INVALID_UTF8, INVALID_MONEY_BRIDGE, DUPLICATE_SOURCE_ID, UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCY;413 LIMIT_EXCEEDED; diagnostics<=50 entries plus truncated flag, no accepted partial bundle.

**Idempotency Retry**
Pure normalization repeatable; SHA covers original bytes. Corrected full bundle creates new revision; raw source never edited.

**Ordering Concurrency**
No state mutation. Stable row_no refers to logical CSV record after header, including quoted multiline fields as one record.

**Fixture**
Existing example bundle/expected.json plus corrected-books example; TASK-02 must create remaining S2-S8 cases before their consumers merge.

**Freeze Point**
Design shape now; executable parser/fixture conformance after TASK-02. Consumer may use documented example and schema before provider internals.

**Verification**
Unit table cases for exact money, Unicode/CSV limits, malformed/empty source, duplicate identity; existing example must yield6680 payout subtotal and incomplete refund books evidence. Planned npm run test:unit after G0; never assert it ran now.

**Lifecycle**
v1 is design-frozen after this plan review; executable freeze requires provider conformance and foundation evidence. No implicit backward-incompatible changes.

**Change Protocol**
Identify every consumer; update this record, examples, generated/typed interfaces, affected packets and edges; rerun conformance; re-sequence before merging a breaking change.

**Security**
Local synthetic demo only; protect application routes with current startup code, exact Host/Origin and owning-revision validation. Never expose secrets or local paths.
